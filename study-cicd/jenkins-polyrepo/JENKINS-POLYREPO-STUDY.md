# 🔧 Jenkins Polyrepo CI/CD - Study Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Polyrepo (multiple repositories) approach where each microservice has its own repository and independent CI/CD pipeline. This guide covers Jenkins implementation for individual service pipelines.

## 📚 Key Concepts

### 🏗️ Polyrepo Architecture
- **Separate Repositories**: Each service in its own repo
- **Independent Pipelines**: Service-specific CI/CD workflows
- **Service Autonomy**: Teams own their service lifecycle
- **Cross-Service Dependencies**: Managed through triggers

### 🔄 Pipeline Characteristics
- **Service-Focused**: Pipeline knows which service it's building
- **Dependency Management**: Triggers downstream services
- **Environment Isolation**: Service-specific deployments
- **Independent Scaling**: Each service scales independently

## 📋 Pipeline Stages Explained

### 🔍 Service Detection
```groovy
environment {
    SERVICE_NAME = "${env.JOB_NAME.split('/')[0]}"
}
```
**Purpose**: Automatically detect service name from Jenkins job
**Key Points**:
- Extracts service name from job path
- Used throughout pipeline for service-specific operations
- Enables reusable pipeline across services

### 🔨 Service-Specific Build
```groovy
stage('Build') {
    steps {
        echo "🔨 Building ${SERVICE_NAME} service..."
        sh '''
            mvn clean compile -DskipTests
            mvn package -DskipTests
        '''
    }
}
```
**Key Features**:
- Service name in logs for clarity
- Single service build (faster than monorepo)
- Service-specific artifacts

### 🧪 Independent Testing
```groovy
stage('Test') {
    parallel {
        stage('Unit Tests') {
            steps {
                echo "🧪 Running unit tests for ${SERVICE_NAME}..."
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Integration Tests') {
            steps {
                echo "🔗 Running integration tests for ${SERVICE_NAME}..."
                sh 'mvn integration-test'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Benefits**:
- Faster test execution (only one service)
- Service-specific test configuration
- Independent test environments

### 📊 Service Quality Analysis
```groovy
stage('Code Quality') {
    steps {
        withSonarQubeEnv('SonarQube') {
            sh '''
                mvn sonar:sonar \
                    -Dsonar.projectKey=${SERVICE_NAME} \
                    -Dsonar.projectName=${SERVICE_NAME}
            '''
        }
    }
}
```
**Key Points**:
- Separate SonarQube project per service
- Service-specific quality metrics
- Independent quality gates

### 🔄 Downstream Triggering
```groovy
stage('Trigger Downstream') {
    steps {
        script {
            def dependencies = [
                'auth-service': ['account-service', 'payment-service'],
                'account-service': ['payment-service'],
                'payment-service': []
            ]
            
            def downstreamServices = dependencies[SERVICE_NAME] ?: []
            
            downstreamServices.each { service ->
                build job: "${service}/${env.BRANCH_NAME}",
                      parameters: [
                          string(name: 'ENVIRONMENT', value: params.ENVIRONMENT)
                      ],
                      wait: false
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Features**:
- Dependency mapping between services
- Automatic downstream triggering
- Asynchronous builds (wait: false)
- Parameter passing to downstream jobs

## 🚀 Polyrepo Benefits

### ✅ Advantages
- **Team Autonomy**: Each team owns their service pipeline
- **Independent Deployment**: Deploy services independently
- **Faster Builds**: Only build changed service
- **Technology Diversity**: Different tech stacks per service
- **Fault Isolation**: Pipeline failures don't affect other services

### ❌ Challenges
- **Dependency Management**: Complex cross-service dependencies
- **Configuration Duplication**: Similar pipeline configs across repos
- **Integration Testing**: Harder to test service interactions
- **Deployment Coordination**: Managing multi-service releases

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 📋 Jenkins Configuration

#### 1. Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs
```groovy
// Create separate jobs for each service
- auth-service (Multi-branch Pipeline)
- account-service (Multi-branch Pipeline)  
- payment-service (Multi-branch Pipeline)
- api-gateway (Multi-branch Pipeline)
```

#### 2. Shared Pipeline Library
```groovy
// Create shared library for common functions
@Library('banking-polyrepo-library') _

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                buildService(SERVICE_NAME)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Cross-Repository Triggers
```groovy
// Configure build triggers between services
properties([
    pipelineTriggers([
        upstream(
            threshold: 'SUCCESS',
            upstreamProjects: 'auth-service/main'
        )
    ])
])
```

## 🔄 Dependency Management

### 📊 Service Dependency Matrix
```
auth-service → account-service → payment-service
            → payment-service
```

### 🔧 Implementation Strategies

#### 1. Build Triggers
```groovy
// Automatic triggering
build job: 'downstream-service/main',
      parameters: [
          string(name: 'UPSTREAM_BUILD', value: env.BUILD_NUMBER)
      ]
```

#### 2. Webhook Integration
```groovy
// Webhook-based triggering
sh """
curl -X POST ${WEBHOOK_URL} \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"service": "${SERVICE_NAME}", "build": "${BUILD_NUMBER}"}'
"""
```

#### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
```groovy
// Message queue integration
publishEvent([
    service: SERVICE_NAME,
    event: 'deployment_complete',
    environment: params.ENVIRONMENT
])
```

## 🚀 Best Practices

### ✅ Pipeline Optimization
- **Shared Libraries**: Common functions across services
- **Template Pipelines**: Standardized pipeline structure
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent service builds
- **Artifact Caching**: Service-specific cache strategies

### 🔒 Security Considerations
- **Service Isolation**: Separate credentials per service
- **Network Policies**: Restrict inter-service communication
- **Secret Management**: Service-specific secrets
- **Access Control**: Team-based repository access

### 📊 Monitoring & Observability
- **Service Metrics**: Individual service build metrics
- **Dependency Tracking**: Monitor cross-service dependencies
- **Deployment Coordination**: Track multi-service releases
- **Failure Analysis**: Service-specific failure patterns

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### 🐛 Common Issues

#### Dependency Loops
```groovy
// Detect and prevent circular dependencies
def checkCircularDependency(service, visited = []) {
    if (service in visited) {
        error "Circular dependency detected: ${visited + [service]}"
    }
    // Continue dependency check...
}
```

#### Build Coordination
```groovy
// Wait for upstream builds
def waitForUpstream(upstreamServices) {
    upstreamServices.each { service ->
        def upstreamBuild = build job: "${service}/${env.BRANCH_NAME}",
                                 wait: true,
                                 propagate: false
        if (upstreamBuild.result != 'SUCCESS') {
            error "Upstream build ${service} failed"
        }
    }
}
```

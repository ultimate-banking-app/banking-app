```

## 🎤 Interview Questions & Answers

### **Microservices Architecture**

**Q: Why did you choose microservices for a banking application?**
```
A: "Banking applications require:
- Service isolation for security (auth separate from payments)
- Independent scaling (payment service may need more resources)
- Technology diversity (different services can use different databases)
- Team autonomy (different teams can own different services)
- Fault isolation (if one service fails, others continue working)

Each service has a single responsibility:
- Auth Service: User authentication and authorization
- Account Service: Account lifecycle management
- Payment Service: Payment processing and validation
- Balance Service: Real-time balance inquiries"
```

**Q: How do you handle data consistency across microservices?**
```
A: "I implemented several patterns:
1. Database per Service: Each service owns its data
2. Eventual Consistency: Accept that data will be eventually consistent
3. Saga Pattern: For distributed transactions (transfer between accounts)
4. Event Sourcing: Audit service maintains event log
5. CQRS: Separate read/write models for balance service

Example: Money transfer involves:
- Debit from source account (Account Service)
- Credit to destination account (Account Service)  
- Log transaction (Audit Service)
- Send notification (Notification Service)"
```

### **Monorepo Strategy**

**Q: Why monorepo instead of separate repositories?**
```
A: "Monorepo provides several advantages for microservices:

Pros:
- Shared code through common modules (entities, utilities)
- Atomic commits across services
- Simplified dependency management
- Consistent tooling and CI/CD
- Easy refactoring across service boundaries
- Single source of truth for all services

Cons I addressed:
- Build optimization: Only build changed services
- CI/CD complexity: Jenkins shared libraries for reusability
- Repository size: Proper .gitignore and artifact management

The shared module contains:
- Common entities (User, Account, Transaction)
- Enums (AccountType, TransactionStatus)
- Utilities and validation logic"
```

**Q: How do you handle versioning in a monorepo?**
```
A: "I use semantic versioning with coordinated releases:
- All services share the same version number
- Shared module version drives service versions
- Git tags mark release points
- Jenkins pipeline handles version bumping
- Backward compatibility maintained through API versioning

Release strategy:
- Feature branches for new functionality
- Release branches for version preparation
- Hotfix branches for critical fixes
- Main branch always deployable"
```

### **CI/CD Pipeline**

**Q: Explain your Jenkins CI/CD pipeline architecture.**
```
A: "I built a sophisticated pipeline with Jenkins shared libraries:

Pipeline Structure:
1. Change Detection: Only build/deploy modified services
2. Parallel Execution: Build all services simultaneously
3. Quality Gates: SonarQube integration with failure blocking
4. Security Scanning: OWASP dependency check, container scanning
5. Multi-Environment: Dev → Staging → Production with approvals

Shared Library Components:
- bankingUtils: Change detection, service discovery
- bankingBuild: Maven build management
- bankingTest: Unit/integration/smoke tests
- bankingDocker: Container image management
- bankingDeploy: Multi-environment deployment
- bankingSecurity: Security scanning suite
- bankingNotification: Slack/email alerts

Key Features:
- Monorepo optimization (only changed services)
- Parallel builds (10 services build simultaneously)
- Security-first approach (multiple scan types)
- Infrastructure as Code (Jenkins Configuration as Code)"
```

**Q: How do you handle deployment strategies?**
```
A: "I implemented multiple deployment strategies:

Development:
- Docker Compose for local development
- Automatic deployment on merge to main
- Health checks before marking deployment successful

Staging:
- Kubernetes deployment with rolling updates
- Integration tests run against staging
- Performance testing environment

Production:
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Manual approval gates
- Canary releases for critical services
- Automatic rollback on health check failures

Deployment Pipeline:
1. Build and test all services
2. Security scanning (OWASP, container scans)
3. Deploy to dev environment
4. Run smoke tests
5. Deploy to staging (if dev tests pass)
6. Run integration tests
7. Manual approval for production
8. Deploy to production with health monitoring"
```

### **Testing Strategy**

**Q: Describe your testing approach for microservices.**
```
A: "I implemented a comprehensive testing pyramid:

Unit Tests (Base of pyramid):
- Spring Boot Test framework
- MockMvc for controller testing
- Mockito for service layer mocking
- JUnit 5 for test structure
- 80%+ code coverage target

Integration Tests:
- TestContainers for database testing
- WireMock for external service mocking
- Spring Boot integration tests
- API contract testing

End-to-End Tests:
- Smoke tests for critical paths
- Health check validation
- Cross-service communication testing

Testing in Pipeline:
- Unit tests run in parallel for all services
- Integration tests run after successful builds
- Smoke tests run after deployment
- Performance tests in staging environment

Example Test Structure:
@SpringBootTest
class AccountServiceTest {
    @Test
    void shouldCreateAccount() {
        // Given: Valid account data
        // When: Create account API called
        // Then: Account created successfully
    }
}"
```

### **Security Implementation**

**Q: How do you ensure security in your banking application?**
```
A: "Security is implemented at multiple layers:

Application Security:
- JWT tokens for authentication (1-hour expiration)
- BCrypt password encryption
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (JPA/Hibernate)
- CORS configuration for API access

Infrastructure Security:
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Database encryption at rest
- Network segmentation (service mesh)
- Container security scanning with Trivy

CI/CD Security:
- OWASP dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Container image security scanning
- Secret detection in code
- Security gates in pipeline (fail on HIGH/CRITICAL)

Operational Security:
- Audit logging for all transactions
- Rate limiting (100 requests/minute)
- Session management with Redis
- Database connection pooling with HikariCP
- Monitoring and alerting for suspicious activities

Compliance:
- PCI DSS considerations for payment processing
- GDPR compliance for user data
- SOX compliance for financial reporting
- Audit trails for regulatory requirements"
```

### **Performance & Scalability**

**Q: How do you handle performance and scalability?**
```
A: "Performance optimization at multiple levels:

Application Level:
- Connection pooling with HikariCP (default 10 connections)
- Redis caching for session data and frequent queries
- Async processing for non-critical operations
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields

Service Level:
- Load balancing with Spring Cloud Gateway
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
- Bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
- Timeout configurations for external calls

Infrastructure Level:
- Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes
- Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics
- Database read replicas for query optimization
- CDN for static content delivery

Monitoring:
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Database query performance monitoring

Scalability Patterns:
- Database per service (no shared databases)
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- CQRS for read/write separation
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions"
```

### **Technology Choices**

**Q: Why did you choose Spring Boot and Java 17?**
```
A: "Technology decisions based on requirements:

Java 17:
- LTS version with long-term support
- Performance improvements (ZGC, improved JIT)
- Modern language features (records, pattern matching)
- Strong ecosystem for enterprise applications

Spring Boot 3.2:
- Production-ready features out of the box
- Excellent microservices support
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Strong security framework
- Actuator for monitoring and health checks
- Auto-configuration reduces boilerplate

Maven:
- Mature dependency management
- Multi-module support for monorepo
- Extensive plugin ecosystem
- Industry standard for Java projects

Alternative Considerations:
- Gradle: More flexible but steeper learning curve
- Node.js: Good for I/O intensive but Java better for complex business logic
- .NET: Microsoft ecosystem lock-in
- Go: Great performance but smaller ecosystem for banking domain"
```

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive

### **Code Examples to Discuss**

#### 1. **Shared Entity Design**
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "accounts")
public class Account {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    @Column(nullable = false)
    private Long userId;
    
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private AccountType accountType;
    
    @Column(precision = 19, scale = 2)
    private BigDecimal balance;
    
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private AccountStatus status;
    
    // Constructors, getters, setters
}
```

#### 2. **Service Implementation Pattern**
```java
@Service
@Transactional
public class AccountService {
    
    private final AccountRepository accountRepository;
    
    public AccountService(AccountRepository accountRepository) {
        this.accountRepository = accountRepository;
    }
    
    public Account createAccount(CreateAccountRequest request) {
        Account account = new Account(
            request.getUserId(),
            request.getAccountType(),
            request.getInitialBalance()
        );
        return accountRepository.save(account);
    }
}
```

#### 3. **Jenkins Shared Library Usage**
```groovy
// In Jenkinsfile
@Library('banking-shared-library') _

pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Build Services') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def changedServices = bankingUtils.detectChangedServices()
                    bankingBuild.buildServices(changedServices)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
